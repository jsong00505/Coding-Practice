# PART1: The Castle Company

This problem is about to build on castle on a peak or a valley.
Please see the below how I implemented the code.

Sample data is [here](samples.txt).

The source code is [here](Main.java).

## How To Test
1. Before run, set the array in Main class first
2. Go to 93 line and modify the array what you want like below
```java
int[] points = {6, 6, 6, 5};
```

3. Run the Main class
4. See the result like below
```
the number of castle: 1
```
